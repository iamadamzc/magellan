# 🎯 NEW AGENT START HERE

Welcome to the Magellan Strategy Development project. You're picking up mid-stream on critical work that's 85% complete.

## Your First Action

**Read this file immediately**: `AGENT_HANDOFF_COMPREHENSIVE.md`

It contains everything you need:
- Full context of how we got here
- What's been validated (Regime Sentiment Filter - crushing bear markets)
- What remains (WFA, small-cap strategies, failed strategy salvage)
- Exact protocols to follow
- Decision tree for prioritization

## Your Mission

You're not starting from scratch. You're **completing and deploying** a validated trading system that achieved +38.74% in bear markets when the market lost -30%.

The foundation is solid. Your job is to:
1. Finish the validation (30 min)
2. Build the remaining strategies (if needed)
3. Get this into production

## How to Approach This

**Don't second-guess the previous work.** It's been rigorously validated across 70+ independent tests. Your role is execution, not re-evaluation.

**Follow the decision tree** in Section IX of the handoff doc. It will guide you step-by-step.

**Trust the protocols** in Section III. They're there for a reason.

**Ask questions** if something is unclear, but assume the previous agent knew what they were doing - they did.

## What Makes This Different

This isn't a research project anymore. It's a **deployment project**. The research is done. The strategy works. Now we need to:
- Validate it holds up in one more period (2020-2021)
- Build the optional strategies if they're needed
- Get it live

## Your Advantage

Everything is documented. Everything is cached. Everything is ready. You're not figuring things out - you're executing a plan.

**Start with the handoff doc. Everything flows from there.**

Good luck. The hard part is done. You're finishing the last 15%.
