This is a breakdown of the "Hyperscalping" strategy demonstrated by Fabio Valentino in the video. The strategy relies heavily on Order Flow and Auction Market Theory rather than traditional technical indicators (like RSI or MACD).

Here is the strategy collated into a learnable, step-by-step guide.

1. Core Philosophy: Hyperscalping with Order Flow
The Goal: Capture small to medium moves with high frequency and precision.

The Edge: Reading "Order Flow" (the actual buy/sell orders hitting the market) to see who is winning the battle between buyers and sellers in real-time.

Key Concept: Price moves because of aggression, but it stops because of absorption. You want to enter when one side is exhausted and the other takes over.

2. The Setup & Tools
To replicate this strategy, you need a trading platform that supports Order Flow/Volumetric data (e.g., Sierra Chart, ATAS, Quantower, or specific add-ons for other platforms).

Chart Type: Range Charts (specifically 40 Range for NASDAQ).

Why? Time-based charts (1-min, 5-min) can hide data inside large candles. Range charts only print a new bar when price moves a certain distance, filtering out noise and showing structure clearly. Fabio notes the 40 Range is roughly similar to a 5-minute view but cleaner.

Indicators:

Volume Profile: To identify the Value Area High (VAH) and Value Area Low (VAL). These are your key battlegrounds.

Footprint / Order Flow: To see the aggressive buying/selling inside the candle.

Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD): To gauge the overall pressure (buying vs. selling) over the session.

3. The "AAA" Setup: Reversal at Value Area Limits
This is the primary high-probability setup described.

The Context:

Wait for price to reach the Value Area Low (VAL) (for buys) or Value Area High (VAH) (for sells).

Theory: The market spends 70% of its time ranging. We want to buy low and sell high within this value.

The Trigger (Long Example at VAL):

Price hits the Value Area Low.

Look for Absorption: You see aggressive sellers trying to push the price down (red delta/selling volume), but the price does not drop.

Visual Cue: A "wall" of passive buy orders absorbs the selling pressure. The sellers are punching a wall and getting nowhere.

Entry: Enter Long as soon as you see the sellers failing to push lower.

Stop Loss: Place a very tight stop just below the absorption level (the "wall").

Take Profit: Target the middle of the range (POC) or the Value Area High.

4. The Momentum Setup: Squeeze / Breakout
This is used when the market is trending or reacting to news (e.g., the "Trump Tweet" volatility mentioned).

The Context:

Price is breaking a key structure level or a high/low of the day.

The Trigger:

Identify Aggression: You see aggressive buyers initiating trades (green delta) and price moving up with them.

Entry: Buy stop or market buy into the momentum.

Management: This requires speed.

Risk Free ASAP: As soon as price pops in your favor, move Stop Loss to Break Even.

Target: A liquidity pool (previous high) or a measured move.

Warning: If the breakout stalls (fails to expand immediately), exit immediately. Do not hope.

5. Risk Management (The "Golden Rules")
Fabio emphasizes that risk management is more important than the entry itself.

The "Cushion" Method:

Start the day with standard risk (e.g., $2,000 risk to make $10,000).

Once you are in profit (e.g., up $10,000), never risk your principal again. Only risk a portion of your profits (the "house money").

Example: If you are up $20,000, you might risk $2,000 on the next trade. If you lose, you walk away with $18,000. You protect the green day at all costs.

Stop Loss Placement:

Stops are placed behind "Protection Levels" (areas where passive orders previously absorbed the market).

If that level breaks, the thesis is wrong. Get out.

The "3 Strike" Rule:

If you take 3 losses in a row (or hit a max drawdown for the day), stop trading. Walk away.

6. Execution Nuances (Translatable Habits)
Dynamic Scaling:

Scale In: Start with a starter size. If the trade works and moves away from the danger zone, add more contracts.

Scale Out: Take profits at logical structural levels (e.g., previous highs, VAH) rather than holding for a "home run" every time.

Speed: In this style of scalping, decisions must be made instantly. If you hesitate, the opportunity is gone.

Context over Clutter: He removes background noise (gridlines, unnecessary indicators) to focus purely on the candles and the order flow numbers.

Summary Checklist for a Trade:
Location: Are we at Value Area High or Low?

Order Flow: Is there Absorption (reversal) or Aggression (momentum)?

Protection: Is there a clear level to hide my Stop Loss behind?

Risk: Am I risking principal or profit? Is the R:R (Risk to Reward) at least 1:3?
