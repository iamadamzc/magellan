Here is the consolidated technical specification for the Top 3 High-Viability Small Cap Strategies.This document synthesizes the structural alpha from my original analysis with the robust risk architecture provided by Agent Chad G and the regime filtering of Agent Dee S.These three strategies were selected to create a balanced portfolio: one for Event-Driven Volatility (Halts), one for Mean Reversion (Traps), and one for Momentum (Trend).Small Cap Algorithmic Strategy SpecificationsGlobal Infrastructure "Must Haves"Before any strategy logic runs, these gates must be passed. This architecture (derived from Agent Chad G) prevents the system from trading in toxic conditions.GateLogicThresholdRationaleLiquidity Gate1m_Dollar_Vol> $250,000Prevents getting stuck in illiquid stocks where you cannot exit.Spread Gate(Ask - Bid) / Bid< 35 bpsIf spread is > 0.35%, slippage destroys the statistical edge. Kill trade.Halt CooldownTime_Since_Resume> 5 minsPause trend logic (Strat 3) immediately after a halt to avoid whipsaws.Broker LocateAPI_QueryTrueCrucial: For any short logic, confirm borrow availability before signal generation.Strategy 1: LULD Halt Arbitrage (Event-Driven)Type: Structural / Latency ArbitragePriority: High (Highest Alpha, Uncorrelated)Source Authority: Original Quant Analysis (Missed by Agents)The "Alpha" Gap (What The Agents Missed)Both agents focused on OHLCV chart patterns. They missed Market Structure. This strategy exploits the rules of the Exchange (Limit Up Limit Down). It does not look at charts; it monitors the Indicative Match Price (IMP) data feed during a volatility halt.Core LogicState: System detects TradingStatus = HALTED (Code M/LULD).Monitor: Subscribe to SIP (Level 1) feed for IMP updates (published every minute).Trigger: If IMP > Last_Halt_Trade_Price by GAP_THRESH immediately before resumption.Execution: Send Limit on Open (LOO) or Aggressive Limit orders milliseconds before the re-open timestamp.Exit: Time-based scalp (10–30 seconds) to capture the resumption volatility flush.Parameter RangesSince the Agents missed this strategy, only Quant ranges are provided.ParameterConservativeAggressiveIdeal StarterGAP_THRESH_PCT5.0%1.5%2.0%MAX_SPREAD_OPEN$0.05$0.25$0.15FLASH_EXIT_SEC10s60s30sENTRY_BUFFER_MS100ms0ms50msStrategy 2: The "Liquidity Trap" (VWAP Reclaim)Type: Mean Reversion / Trap TradingPriority: Medium (High Win Rate)Source Authority: Hybrid: Chad G (Strat 10) + Expert Wick LogicThe "Alpha" Gap (What The Agents Missed)Chad G identified the "Support Sweep" (breaking a low to trigger stops).The Expert Fix: Chad missed the Wick Validation. You must calculate the ratio of the lower wick to the body. This proves that limit orders absorbed the selling. Without this check, you are just "catching a falling knife."Core LogicContext: Price breaks below a key support (Low of Day or VWAP).The Trap: The breakdown candle forms a "Hammer" shape where the Lower Wick is > 40% of the total candle range.Trigger: Price Reclaims (closes back above) the broken support level.Confirmation: Volume on the reclaim candle > RECLAIM_VOL_MULT * Avg Volume.Parameter RangesParameterAgent RecommendationQuant OptimizationRationaleSWEEP_DEPTH25 bps (Chad)25 – 50 bpsNeeds to break deep enough to trigger retail stops.WICK_RATIO0.25 (Chad)> 0.400.25 is too weak; 0.40 proves institutional absorption.RECLAIM_VOL1.4x (Chad)1.5x – 2.0xNeeds volume conviction to confirm the reversal.STOP_LOSS0.45 ATR (Chad)Wick Low - $0.01Use a hard stop below the trap. If it breaks, the setup is dead.MAX_HOLD40 min (Chad)20 minReversals must be V-shaped. If it lingers, exit.Strategy 3: Multi-Frame PMH Breakout (Trend)Type: Momentum / Trend FollowingPriority: Medium (Scalability)Source Authority: Hybrid: Chad G (Strat 7) + Dee S (Strat 5)The "Alpha" Gap (What The Agents Missed)Chad G provided the best entry mechanics (Pre-Market High).Dee S provided the necessary filter (Fractal Momentum).The Expert Fix: You must enforce a Regime Filter. Breakouts fail 70% of the time in small caps. By forcing the system to check the 5-Minute ADX (Trend Strength) before taking a 1-Minute entry, you filter out "choppy" fake-outs.Core LogicRegime Filter (Dee S): 5-Minute Chart ADX > 25 (Strong Trend) AND Price > 5-min EMA(9).Setup (Chad G): Stock Gapped up > 15% in Pre-Market.Trigger: Price breaks Pre-Market High (PMH) on the 1-minute chart.L2 Validation: Ask Liquidity must deplete rapidly (high print rate) at the breakout level before price moves.Parameter RangesParameterAgent RecommendationQuant OptimizationRationaleMIN_GAP_PCT1.5% - 4.0% (Dee)> 15.0%Small caps need massive catalysts to run. 4% is noise.BREAKOUT_VOL2.0x (Chad)3.0xNeeds overwhelming demand to clear L2 sell walls.HTF_ADX> 20 (Dee)> 25 (5-min)Validates the "Big Picture" trend before entry.ENTRY_BUFFER$0.02 (Chad)$0.02Buy slightly above the level to avoid micro-fakes.MAX_SPREAD35 bps (Chad)< 30 bpsBreakouts require market orders; spread must be tight.Development Roadmap: What to Build FirstThe Gatekeeper: Write the check_spread() and check_liquidity() functions. Do not trade a single share until these work (Chad G's best contribution).The LULD Sniper: This is your highest profit potential. Focus on the SIP Data connection and latency.The Trap: This is your daily "bread and butter." Focus on the wick_calculation math.The Trend: Build this last. It requires the most complex logic (Multi-Timeframe data syncing) and is the most prone to false signals.
