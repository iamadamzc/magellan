## 4. ROBUSTNESS CHECK

The Champion (TP=120/SL=20) was compared against neighboring parameter combinations (±5 SL, ±20 TP):

| TP/SL Combo | Net PnL | Status |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| TP=120/SL=20 | $1,688,365.50 | ⭐ Champion |
| TP=120/SL=25 | $1,685,543.00 |  |
| TP=120/SL=18 | $1,683,880.00 |  |
| TP=120/SL=15 | $1,660,660.00 |  |
| TP=100/SL=20 | $1,376,085.50 |  |
| TP=100/SL=18 | $1,373,840.00 |  |
| TP=100/SL=25 | $1,369,783.00 |  |
| TP=100/SL=15 | $1,356,500.00 |  |

**Statistics:**
- Average PnL of neighbors: $1,524,332.12
- Std Dev of neighbors: $166,310.68
- Champion deviation: 1.0σ

**Verdict:** ✅ Champion is ROBUST - nearby parameters also perform well

## Methodology

- **Data:** MNQ_CLEAN_OUTRIGHTS_ONLY.csv (2025 Out-of-Sample)
- **Time Window:** 02:00 - 06:00 UTC (Asian Session)
- **Friction:** $6.50 per trade ($2.50 commission + 2.0 pts slippage)
- **Time Limit:** 60 minutes (exit at market if neither TP nor SL hit)
- **Worst-Case Execution:** If both TP and SL hit on same bar, assume SL hit first
- **Entry Signals:** Decision Tree classifier trained on 2021-2024 data
