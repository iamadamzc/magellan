KEY INSIGHT: What Are We Excluding?
================================================================================

We are NOT losing MNQ data. We are REMOVING CONTAMINATION.

Calendar Spreads (what we're removing):
  - These are DIFFERENT instruments (e.g., MNQZ5-MNQH6)
  - They trade at ~$250-500 (the DIFFERENCE between two contracts)
  - They are NOT the MNQ futures price
  - Including them corrupts: Lows, Velocity, ATR, Wick ratios

Outright Contracts (what we're keeping):
  - These are the ACTUAL MNQ futures (e.g., MNQZ5, MNQH6)
  - They trade at ~$15,000-$26,000
  - This is what TradingView shows, what you trade

IMPACT ON GOLDEN WINDOW (02:00-06:00 UTC)
================================================================================

June 2025 Golden Window (02:00-06:00 UTC):
  Total rows:    8,480
  Spread rows:   326 (contamination)
  Outright rows: 8,154 (clean data)
  % Clean:       96.2%

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

By excluding calendar spreads:
  - We KEEP ~96% of the data
  - We REMOVE ~4% contamination

This will NOT adversely affect results. In fact, it will:
  1. IMPROVE accuracy (no more ghost crashes)
  2. INCREASE confidence (clean data = trustworthy signals)
  3. VALIDATE the strategy properly (apples to apples)

The Sanity Filter already proved the edge survives (75% win rate)
after removing extreme velocity signals caused by these spreads.
