This is a classic algorithmic failure mode known as the "Scalper's Trap."You have successfully solved the hardest part of algo trading: Accuracy (62% is excellent). However, you have inverted your Expectancy. Your data shows that while you are winning more often, your winners are too small to pay for your losers.The Diagnosis: Why You Are Losing MoneyLet's reverse-engineer your V5 performance:Win Scenario: You sell 50% at 0.5R. Even if the rest runs, your "Weighted Average Win" is dragged down to ~0.7R. In reality, after slippage and spread, this is likely ~0.5R.Loss Scenario: You take a full -1.0R loss. With a 0.4 ATR stop (which is extremely tight), slippage likely expands this to -1.2R.The Math: You are risking $1.20 to make $0.50.Expectancy = (0.62 * 0.50) - (0.38 * 1.20) = -0.14RVerdict: You are buying a high win rate by selling your profitability.Tuning Recommendations for V6To flip the Avg P&L positive, you must uncap your winners and stop choking the trade.1. Replace "Early Scale" with "Breakeven Trigger"Scaling out at 0.5R is the primary killer. You are selling your best position size for crumbs.The Fix: Do NOT sell at 0.5R.New Rule: When price hits +0.5R (or +0.7R), move your Stop Loss to Breakeven.Why: This accomplishes the same goal (protecting the win rate) without capping your upside. It gives you a "free ride" to a real profit target.2. Widen the Stop (Survive the Noise)A 0.4 ATR stop in small caps is often smaller than the bid-ask spread. You are getting stopped out by random market noise rather than structural failure.The Fix: Widen Stop to 0.75 ATR (or Low of the Pullback Candle).Crucial Adjustment: Reduce Share Size by ~40% to keep your dollar risk constant.3. Push Targets to Minimum 1.3RYou need your winners to be larger than your losers.The Fix: Set Take Profit 1 to 1.3R (Sell 50%).The Fix: Set Take Profit 2 to Runner (Trail via VWAP).Why: A 50% Win Rate with a 1.3R average win is mathematically profitable. A 62% win rate with a 0.5R win is not.4. Re-Introduce "Zombie" Time StopYou removed the 30-min stop (correct, it was too long), but having no time stop is dragging down your P&L with dead trades.The Fix: Add a Conditional Time Stop.Logic: IF (Time_In_Trade > 10 Minutes) AND (Unrealized_PnL < 0.5R) THEN EXIT.Why: Momentum is binary. If it hasn't popped in 10 minutes, the setup has likely failed. Kill it at scratch.Suggested V6 ConfigurationRun your next test with these parameters. The goal is to flip the Avg P&L positive, even if the Win Rate drops slightly to ~50-55%.ParameterV5 (Current)V6 RecommendationRationaleStop Loss0.4 ATR0.75 ATR (or Candle Low)Move stop outside of spread noise.Mgmt ActionScale 50% @ 0.5RMove Stop to BE @ 0.5RProtects the win without capping profit.Take Profit 11.0 R1.3 RWinner must pay for the loser + slippage.RunnerNoneTrail (VWAP)Capture the "Fat Tail" outliers.Time StopNone10 Minutes (Conditional)Kill zombie trades early.Share SizeStandardReduce ~40%Compensate for the wider stop loss.What to Expect in V6Win Rate: Will likely drop (50% - 55%) because you aren't banking the quick 0.5R scalps.Avg P&L: Should flip Positive.Total P&L: Should turn Green.
